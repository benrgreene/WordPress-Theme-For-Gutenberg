# Ben's Theme for Gutenberg

This is a theme built around sites using the new Gutenberg editor. It offers custom blocks and block settings to allow for more customizable pages and posts. Let's get started on learning what those are.

## Custom Blocks

### Sidebar Block

This is a custom block that adds the page's selected sidebar next to the content added in the block. This allows for placing the sidebar by any content, meaning you can add full width content above or beneath the sidebar.

This block does allow for child blocks, meaning that you can add sliders, multiple paragrahs, lists, whatever you want!

## Custom Block Settings

### Layout Type

This allows for setting if the block should be full-width, or contained (has a max width).

### Vertical Spacing

This sets how much space should be placed above and beneath the block. This could allow for blocks to placed flush one above the other.
